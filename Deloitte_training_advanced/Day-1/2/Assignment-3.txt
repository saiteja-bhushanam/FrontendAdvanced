1.== just compares the value where as === will also compare the datatype
2. isNaN() will return true if not a number and it will return false if its a number

Client vs. server scripting
Client-side scripting	Server-side scripting
Runs on the user's computer, i .e. browser interprets the script	Runs on the web server
Source code is visible to the user.	Source code is not visible to the user because the output of a server-side program is an HTML page.
Used for validations and functionality for the user events	Used for business logic and data access from the database. The pages are created dynamically.
Depends on the browser and version.	Doesn't depend on the client. Any server-side technology can be used.
